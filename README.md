# i3wm-configs

This is a repository containing my i3wm configuration files.

My setup is i3wm on Linux Mint.

Several principles I followed to configure everything:
- Stay simple, possibly with some functionalities as trade-offs.
- Linux Mint provides a strong set of utilities (especially included in `cinnamon-settings`). Reuse these if they are not crucial or frequently used interfaces.
- Keep structured and modularised.
